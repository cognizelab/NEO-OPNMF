# Introduction

The core code and models in the article "Charting the Meta-Trait Landscape of Human Personality".

The primary objective of this code library is to facilitate the factor decomposition of behavioral data using [Orthogonal Projection Non-negative Matrix Factorization (OPNMF)](https://github.com/asotiras/brainparts), and to appropriately visualize the results.

All operations are implemented in MATLAB (version 2021a or later), and the code runs without requiring any additional dependencies.
